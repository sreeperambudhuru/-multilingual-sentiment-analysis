# Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning 🧠

This project explores sentiment classification across six Indian languages using basic NLP and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Summary
- Created a multilingual dataset with 30+ rows (English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali)
- Preprocessed text using NLTK and stopword removal (English)
- Vectorized using TfidfVectorizer
- Trained Logistic Regression model to classify sentiment
- Generated WordCloud visualizations
- Evaluated model performance and improved accuracy with dataset tuning

## 📁 Files Included
- `Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis_Harini.pdf`: Full project with code, output, and WordCloud

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Tfidf, Logistic Regression, Matplotlib

## 🎯 Accuracy
Achieved ~50% accuracy on a multilingual dataset using a simple model. Recognized the limitations of tokenization across scripts and focused on modeling fundamentals.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add Indic NLP support for better tokenization
- Use real-world tweet data
- Apply multilingual transformer models like mBERT
